## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I used this project to practice and get better at using Tailwind. At the start, it was absolutely horrible trying to get used to using Tailwind instead of vanilla CSS. I was so close to giving up and just switching to CSS, but I beared through. But the nice thing is, after understanding the quirks of it and getting used to the class names, I began to see the usefulness of it. It's nice to not have to come up with class names, and switching back and forth between the html and the stylesheet file. Having it all self contained in the same place it's affecting is really convenient. 

Other than that, the logic for the displaying everything properly, validation and managing which steps the user is allowed to access kinda hurt my brain. Fortunately, it's just simple JavaScript logic and I manage to figure it out eventually.

### Continued development

I need to improve how I write my JavaScript code. It always ends up looking a bit messy after I'm done, so I should try to consider how it's going to look if I'm looking back into it after a period of time. At least I got into TypeScript now, so it should be less ambiguous than it would have otherwise. Although, TypeScript does inflate the code a bit, but oh well.
